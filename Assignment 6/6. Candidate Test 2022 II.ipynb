    "# Candidate Test 2022 Analysis Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise focuses on the candidate tests from two television networks: DR and TV2. Data from both tests have been given on a scale of five responses (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2). Consider normalizing the data or performing similar scaling transformations as needed.\n",

    "There are 6 datasets included in this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `alldata.xlsx`: Contains responses from both TV stations.\n",
    "- `drdata.xlsx`: Contains responses from DR.\n",
    "- `drq.xlsx`: Contains questions from DR.\n",
    "- `tv2data.xlsx`: Contains responses from TV2.\n",
    "- `tv2q.xlsx`: Contains questions from TV2.\n",
    "- `electeddata.xlsx`: Contains responses from both TV stations for candidates who were elected to the parliament. Note that 9 members are missing; 7 of them didn't take any of the tests. Additionally, some notable figures like Mette F. and Lars Løkke did not participate in any of the tests.\n",

    "It's entirely up to you how you approach this data, but at a *minimum*, your analysis should include:\n",

    "- An analysis/description of which questions are most crucial concerning their placement on the axes.\n",
    "- Average positions of parties concerning each question, preferably with accompanying plots of each (or selected) question.\n",
    "- A clustering analysis where you attempt various cluster numbers, which would correspond to different parties. Discuss whether there is room for more clusters/parties or if a reduction is needed. Make sure you cover: **K-Means, Hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN.**\n",
    "- An overview of the political landscape of the elected candidates, highlighting which members agree or disagree the most and which parties or party members have significant disagreements.\n",
    "- Feel free to explore further and remember that preprocessing, methodology, and evaluation metrics are not mentioned explicitly, but are implicitly assumed.\n",
