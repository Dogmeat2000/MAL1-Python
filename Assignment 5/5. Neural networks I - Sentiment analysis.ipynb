      "what happened   doubt  had so much potential to be a brilliant film  but instead it faltered with a dragging simplistic plot line which made me want to stop watching . the only thing the film had going for it was the brilliance of meryl streep  who no doubt deserved the oscar  nomination . though it was not one of her best performances  she still gave a solid and truthful character to us which blossomed through the screen .  br    br   however  not even the brilliance of a screen legend could save this film from going down hill . from the boring start  which had no power or punch  to the less than convincing ending  the film was truly a disappointment  especially since it provided so much potential through its promotion and trailers . it was obvious the director had trouble with the simplicity of the plot and he ended up with a boring film  which dragged on for too long  with too much talk and not enough action .  br    br   furthermore  the other oscar  nominations were less than convincing . though philip seymour hoffman gave a decent performance  it was by no means oscar  worthy .  especially since they completely left out performances such as will smith  in seven pounds  . amy adams did not deserve the nomination . watching amy adams was like watching a cardboard box  as it was one sided and plain . it would have made more sense to nominate her for a razzie  as i am sure she would have walked away victorious . viola davis gave a short but truthful performance  but the length of her performance made me question whether the academy really should have given her the nomination .  br    br   overall  i consider doubt to be one of the most disappointing films of     . it was a mess of a film with so much potential  and i do not recommend it . the only shining light in the film is meryl streep  who though gives a stunning  solid performance  doesn  t even do enough to save this film .     .  \n",

    "**Whole Review:** We see that the whole review is represented by a number of individual words. The bag of words, when fitted, stores each words in a vector with a weight assigned to each word corresponding to how many times the individual word appears in the review/text. It is worth noting that the review is only displayed using the top words that were fit into the primary bag of words trained vector (i.e. 10.000 top words). That causes 'holes' to appear, when reading the review. In essence, the bag of words vector represents a 10.000 dimensional array, where most values are zero (sparse) and if a word appears in the review, it's index will have a non-zero count.\n",

Comparing to the final test accuracy at 85.6% with the final validation accuracy at 85.95% these values seem to correlate nicely, suggesting a good fit. It could be interesting to see what happens if I reduce the overfitting (decrease the val_loss in the epochs) and see how this translates to model accuracy on validation and test data.\n",

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "The overall training of the neural network and predictions seem faily accurate, albeit not entirely. The bag of words principle works surprisingly well, combined with Artificial Neural Networks (Such as the sequential classifier used). I wonder if using more than 1 hidden layer might improve accuracy without introducing more bias - but that is something that must be tested separately. The trained model still struggles with the reviews that are neither good or bad (the neutral ones), as displayed in my custom_sentences, where I wrote a good review, a bad review and a neutral review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another point I'm wondering, is it I could improve bag of words performance by filtering out common words such as 'the', 'or', 'and', etc. as these are neither positively or negatively loaded. This could provide more room for more relevant words. Or I could simply increase the number of features. This is also something that must be tested separately."
