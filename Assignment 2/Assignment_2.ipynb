    "# EV Car Prices\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment focuses on car prices. The data ('car_prices.xlsx') is a pre-processed version of original data scraped from bilbasen.dk by previous MAL1 students. The dataset contains 16 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Price (DKK)**: The current listed price of the vehicle in Danish Kroner.\n",
    "- **Model Year**: The manufacturing year of the vehicle.\n",
    "- **Mileage (km)**: The total kilometres driven by the vehicle (odometer reading).\n",
    "- **Electric Range (km)**: The estimated maximum driving range on a full charge.\n",
    "- **Battery Capacity (kWh)**: The total capacity of the vehicle's battery in kilowatt-hours.\n",
    "- **Energy Consumption (Wh/km)**: The vehicle's energy consumption in watt-hours per kilometre.\n",
    "- **Annual Road Tax (DKK)**: The annual road tax cost in Danish Kroner.\n",
    "- **Horsepower (bhp)**: The vehicle's horsepower (brake horsepower).\n",
    "- **0-100 km/h (s)**: The time (in seconds) for the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h.\n",
    "- **Top Speed (km/h)**: The maximum speed the vehicle can achieve.\n",
    "- **Towing Capacity (kg)**: The maximum weight the vehicle can tow.\n",
    "- **Original Price (DKK)**: The price of the vehicle when first sold as new.\n",
    "- **Number of Doors**: The total number of doors on the vehicle.\n",
    "- **Rear-Wheel Drive**: A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) for rear-wheel drive.\n",
    "- **All-Wheel Drive (AWD)**: A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) for all-wheel drive.\n",
    "- **Front-Wheel Drive**: A binary indicator (1 = Yes, 0 = No) for front-wheel drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first one, **Price**, is the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **objective** of this assignment is:\n",
    "1. Understand how linear algebra is used in Machine Learning, specifically for correlations and regression\n",
    "2. Learn how to perform multiple linear regression, ridge regression, lasso regression and elastic net\n",
    "3. Learn how to assess regression models\n",
    "\n",
    "Please solve the tasks using this notebook as you template, i.e. insert code blocks and markdown block to this notebook and hand it in. Please use 42 as your random seed.\n"

    " - Split the data in a training set and test set - make sure you extract the response variable\n",
    " - Remember to use the data appropriately; in the tasks below, we do not explicitly state when to use train and test - but in order to compare the models, you must use the same dataset for training and testing in all models.\n",
    " - Output: When you are done with this, you should have the following sets: `X` (the original dataset), `X_train`, `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, `y_test`"
